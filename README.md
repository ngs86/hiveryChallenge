I assume that java and mongodb are installed locally on default port without credential.
Run startup.cmd to import json files and run challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
After running that rest api can be accessible on http://localhost:8080
there are 3 endpoints with these pathes:
  1- /company/{index}/employees
  2- /commonAliveBrownEyesFriends/{firstPeopleInx}/{firstPeopleInx}
  3- /people/{index}/FavoriteFruitsAndVegetables
